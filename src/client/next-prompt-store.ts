/**
 * Next-prompt suggestion controller (plan dsh-advisor-next-prompt-n12,
 * task 3). One instance per session scope binding: it polls/fetches the
 * single-line next-prompt suggestion the reviewer stored for the session's
 * next turn (`/api/advisor/suggestion`, T2) and exposes it through a
 * uSES-safe snapshot store the ghost overlay renders from.
 *
 * Wire contract (src/gateway.ts, T2): `{ suggestion: string | null }` on
 * success; plugin-domain tagged errors ride in RETURNED data —
 * `advisor/rejected` (empty/invalid sessionId) and `advisor/unavailable`
 * (no elected owner on the serving fiber) — never a thrown coded failure.
 * Every failure shape (tagged error, `ok:false` transport fold, malformed
 * payload, or a throw) settles `status: 'unavailable'` with
 * `suggestion: null`: the ghost renders nothing and the NEXT fetch point
 * (consumed refresh signal or scheduled idle poll) is the next attempt —
 * the controller never retries on its own.
 *
 * Ordering is fenced by a monotonic `requestSeq` (the same generation-fence
 * shape as `AdvisorSessionModelController`): a newer fetch supersedes an
 * unresolved older one, whose settle is discarded wholesale — a late
 * response can never overwrite a newer answer.
